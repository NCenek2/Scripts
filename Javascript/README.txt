Welcome to the javascript folder. This folder has older projects
that I have removed from my portfolio. To view, users would need
React set up, bootstrap cdn links, and an appropriate app component.

The exception here is for the dice-randomizer. In its folder, you can
access a corresponding html file to access the project.

About:
calculator
  Just as it sounds, this project is a calculator. It seems like
  the logic would be simple, but it turned out to be a little harder
  than what I had originally expected.

colorBox
  This project allows a user to type in a color (that CSS accepts)
  and the color will be show in the box. Pressing the space-bar
  will clear the input field.

dice-randomizer
  This dice randomizer was a project that I had completed through
  a Udemy course. The user can click the button to roll the die.

dogAPI
  This project made calls to an api which returned back pictures
  of dogs. The user can select which dogs they like, and once
  selected, they will be shown in card order with slight animations.

soundDrum
  This project came through a FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The users
  can click the buttons on the webpage to play a sound or use
  the keyboard.

timer
  This project came through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The user
  can choose a workout time and a rest time. Once the time is ended,
  an alarm will sound, and the rest period will begin. The user can
  pause or reset like a usual timer.

Fruit Store
  This project was my first attempt to create a ECommerce site with
  fruit as the items to select from. The user can go through buy fruits
  and then select their quantities and check the total price at the end.
