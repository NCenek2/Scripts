Welcome to the Matlab Folder. This Matlab code is from my projectile
motion app. You can install the game with the Matlab App Installer
provided that you have Matlab installed on your device.

About:
The user can choose a difficulty level of Easy, Medium, or Hard.
As the difficulty increases, the target distance increases and the
target gets smaller. You can toggle gravity, choose your angle and
speed of trajectory with the sliders. Each difficulty has 10 levels,
and after completing 10 levels on a lower difficulty, you will be 
promoted to a higher difficulty. If you manage to hit the 10 targets,
on Hard, the user will win.

You have three attempts on each target, otherwise the user will lose 
and be demote back to level 1 on Easy.

Hope you Enjoy!
